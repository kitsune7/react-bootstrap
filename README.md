# react-bootstrap
A bootstrap repository for getting a React.js project started up quickly

This is an opinionated bootstrap. Some decisions are made upfront to remove the hassle. Feel free to make changes after
you set things up.

## Setup
Just run the following command and respond to the prompts.

```bash
npm run setup
```

You'll have the option to automatically push your new repository to GitHub. In order for this to work, you'll need to
use the correct username and have ssh setup with GitHub in advance.
