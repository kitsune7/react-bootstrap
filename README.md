# react-bootstrap

A bootstrap repository for getting a React.js project started up quickly

This is an opinionated bootstrap. Some decisions are made upfront to remove the hassle. Feel free to make changes after
you set things up.

## Setup

Just run the following command and respond to the prompts.

```bash
npm run setup
```

You'll have the option to automatically connect your new repository to GitHub. In order for this to work, you'll need to
create the repository on GitHub first. The name you enter in the setup prompt and the name of the repository on GitHub
should match exactly. Your global git config should also have the correct information for your commits to work as you
expect them to.
